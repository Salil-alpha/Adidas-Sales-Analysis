Problem Challenges/Opportunity:
With respect to the current business state of the company, following are some of the problems and the opportunities that can be adhered to have a better enhancement of the brand with respect to their growth.

Problems:

1. Adidas has an unhealthy reliance on the shoe market as a percentage of total revenues.

2. Less visibility on the purchasing methods used by the consumers leading to a haywire in the marketing strategy.


Opportunities:

1. Due to its early success in the e-commerce sector, it has a wealth of prospects for sales and consumer involvement on digital platforms.

2. The success and market dominance of Adidas depend on the company's ability to consistently produce innovative, high-quality goods.


Analytical Framework:
Now, talking about the analytical framework, well, this report works on multiple aspects to solve the previously mentioned issues and the problems relating to the current marketing and sales strategy of the brand ‘Adidas’. Setting the right KPIs to have a direction of the state and then adopting various data analytics methodologies and creating an interactive dashboard to generate insights that will eventually lead us to give some resolution in either solving or reducing the pain caused by the approaches of the brand to the firm itself.  

Talking about KPIs, following are the two major KPIs for this analysis:

1. Sales Diversification – It is nothing but the measure of the diversity created in the firm in regard to its sales approaches. For instance, the current state is such that the firm is highly dependent only on the shoe market for its revenue and sales. Sales diversification is the measure of this metric that how far the firm has come in terms of its focus on other potential areas of creating sales and increasing the profit margin.

2. CSAT – It is a customer satisfaction metric, which measures how satisfied the customers are with the current behavior of the business towards them. Analyzing which methods, the customers opt for in different regions and areas and then enabling that comfort zone for the consumers makes them come back to the brand and keeps them satisfied with the value they get from the business.

Following this is a dashboard that creates insights out of the gathered and pre-processed data. Some of the major activities involved in making this possible are:

Data Gathering – This is the first step, where the data is collected from trusted sources.

Data Pre-processing – This is the next step where any sort of data anomalies is corrected like structural errors, spelling errors, missing values, and others.

Data Analysis – This phase is nothing but understanding the data and creating a plan to analyze the data in various ways like creating visuals or doing exploratory analysis.

Data Visualization – In this step, graphs, charts, and various pivots are created to create meaningful insights. In the end, a dashboard is created that gives a collated view of all the insights generated in one picture. Also, with the aid of this dashboard, there is always a tendency that newer insights can be catered to.

Implantation of the Solution – After having insights, the firm will take decisions basis that to implement them and put things on the pilot to test each of their hypothesis towards creating a better KPI for their brand.

The data.world platform now allows data engineers, stewards, and administrators to monitor and be warned about data pipeline irregularities thanks to a relationship with Monte Carlo, the data dependability firm, and a forthcoming collaboration with its industry-leading information observability technology. Hence, it is a reliable source of data collection and gathering for performing one-hand analysis.

Data Preparation:
